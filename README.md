## Introduction
A sad truth is that one in five dogs that enters a shelter will never end up leaving. Even with the best intentions, most people are unaware that by returning a dog to a shelter adds almost a 50% chance of contributing to a dog not having a chance to be adopted again.

Instead, we hope to provide an opportunity for people interesting in providing a dog a home to select a dog that's right for their life -- not just what is appealing on paper!

## Features
Tasked with building a MERN (Mongo, Express, React and Node) application, we decided to make things even harder on ourselves!

We decided to try to create (with varying success):

- A custom continuous deployment (CD) implementation using the Kudu build engine offered by [Microsoft Azure's Web App services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/).
- A custom social identity authentication system using an integration with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).

## Technologies

These are some of the technologies we used:

- ReactJS
- Express
- Materialize.css and Material-UI
- Google Fonts
- Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB
  - Mongoose
- Axios
- Petfinder v2.0 API

## Acknowledgements

We certainly had a bunch of help with this ðŸ¥°
