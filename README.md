## Introduction

## Features
Tasked with building a MERN (Mongo, Express, React and Node) application, we decided to make things even harder on ourselves!

On top of the project requirements, this application utilizes:

- A custom continuous deployment (CD) implementation using the Kudu build engine offered by [Microsoft Azure's Web App services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/).
- A custom social identity authentication system using an integration with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).

## Acknowledgements

We certainly had a bunch of help with this ðŸ¥°
